# BACKEND_HOTEL
Adding functionality to my FRONTEND _HOTEL project. A database was added to collect applications for further communication with the client. For operators, there is a separate link (/Home/AdminTable) to the project where you can see the client number, departure date, the country where the client wants to go, the number of nights and the number of tourists. This is the simplest but necessary implementation that I have implemented so far. At the end of time, new chips will be added to the project.
